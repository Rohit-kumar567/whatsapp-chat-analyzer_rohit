   * Save the exported `.txt` file.

2. Run the Streamlit app:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

3. Upload your chat `.txt` file via the sidebar.

4. Select either **Overall** (group-level analysis) or a **specific user** for detailed analysis.

## 📦 Requirements

Dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`:

* `streamlit`

## 📝 Notes

* The app supports **Hinglish stopword removal** using `stop_hinglish.txt`.
